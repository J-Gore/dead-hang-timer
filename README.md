# dead-hang-timer
Timer created using an Arduino uno, 595 Shift register, 4 digit 7 seg display and a pressure mat salvaged from a GCSE electronics project. Used to time dead hangs accurately.

Created after my internet was fried in a thunder storm, hence the paint diagram for the display as I had to figure out how it worked.
